Subject: [PATCH 5/5] bottlerocket: fix procfs path on host

Bottlerocket runs the ECS agent directly on the host rather than in a
container.  In other environments, the ECS agent runs in a container
with `/host` mounted as the host's root filesystem and can read the
host's `procfs` at `/host/proc`.  Because Bottlerocket does not run the
ECS agent in a container, the ECS agent can directly read the host's
`procfs` at `/proc`.
